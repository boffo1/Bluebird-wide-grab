# Bluebird-wide-grab

Wide grab window borders for Xubuntu/xfce4 Bluebird theme.

Theme by a one handed Bluebird lover.

N.B.  
    This theme gives the user a wider window border grab area, of about 12 pixels for the borders and 32 pixels for the bottom corners.

The difference between the contents of this folder and the original Bluebird theme folder, is the files:
bottom-active.xpm, bottom-inactive.xpm, bottom-left-active.xpm, bottom-left-inactive.xpm, bottom-right-active.xpm, bottom-right-inactive.xpm,
left-active.xpm, left-inactive.xpm, right-active.xpm, right-inactive.xpm have been copied from "Default-xhdpi" theme.

The top window border has not beeb changed, as doing so would play havoc with the menu function.  
This is a real hack, because it does not look as elegant as it should, but it serves functionality for an mono-amputee. 

The .xpm files can be manually edit with a basic text editor, e.g. "Mousepad", if one wishes to change the colours or borders size.  
Copy the entire folder "Bluebird-wide-grab" and paste into "/usr/share/themes/"
